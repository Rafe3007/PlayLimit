### PlayLimit
A Spigot Minecraft plugin for versions 1.17+. 

This plugin is to help players keep track of time while playing on their favorite servers by giving them the ability to setup an in-game accountability timer. There are two modes:
- Strict Mode: kicks and bans the player from the server for however long they establish in the command. 
- Notify Mode: Only kicks the player letting them know they have reached the limit. They may rejoin instantly if they choose to
There are warning texts at the 10, 5 and 1 mintute mark to let them wrap up whatever they are doing.
- Dirctions with how to install on the [SpigotMC site](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playlimit.81453/).
